Edits by CD 27/08:

1) Moved article to standard The MagPi template.
2) Moved objects to layers within the template.
3) Added github link in the Finally section of the article.
4) Corrected various grammatical errors to aid readability.
5) Changed text to use styles: Body Heading and Body Text (ie: replacing Arial with Freesans Regular), then inreased Body Text style spacing to 13pt as it looked a little cramped.
6) Changed heading text box dimensions to match template.
7) Split "And we did it!" into its own section.
